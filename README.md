# Cars

This was one of my side projects which I developed to see how far have I learned about Android Development. 

> HOW TO RUN?

Simply download the src file and import it in Android Studio, after the gradle build is successful, you should be able to run the application on your mobile phones.

> WHAT IS THE APPLICATION ABOUT?

This application is about fragments in android development. I have used multiple fragments on a single activity to learn how they work under certain situations.
The application starts off with a Splash Screen then to a main activity where you can see list of cars already added at the backed for your ease, a few buttons to interact with
the application and a recycler view where all cars along with their owners are dislayed.
